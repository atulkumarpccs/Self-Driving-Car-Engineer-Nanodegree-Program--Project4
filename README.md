# Project 4 : Advanced Lane Finding 
[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

The second  assignement project  in Term 1 for submission. 


[Udacity Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/self-driving-car-engineer-nanodegree--nd013)

In this project, your goal is to write a software pipeline to identify the lane boundaries in a video from a front-facing camera on a car. The camera calibration images, test road images, and project videos are available in 
<https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Advanced-Lane-Lines>

## Submission Requirment :
 1.Writeup
 
 2.Code (or a Jupyter notebook)
 
 3.Example output images. 
 
 4.Output Video.
 
 ### Acceptance Criteria :
 <https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/322/view>
 
 ### Setup Environmet :
 1.Set up `Starter Kit Installation`
 
   setup by using Anaconda
   <https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit/blob/master/README.md>
   
 2.TensorFlow
If you have access to a GPU, you should follow the TensorFlow instructions for installing TensorFlow with GPU support.

Once you've installed all of the necessary dependencies, you can install the tensorflow-gpu package:
```sh
pip install tensorflow-gpu
```

Amazon Web Services
Instead of a local GPU, you could use Amazon Web Services to launch an EC2 GPU instance. (This costs money.)

Follow the Udacity instructions to launch an EC2 GPU instance with the udacity-carnd AMI.
Complete the Setup instructions. 

 ### Build Steps :
 ```sh
 1.All steps are based on windows 10 environement.
 
 2.Acivate the environement set in first projects ``activate carnd-term1``
 
 3.Clone the project from github >>``git clone https://github.com/atulkumarpccs/Self-Driving-Car-Engineer-Nanodegree-Program--Project2 `` 
 
 4.Go to the submission folder/directory >>..Project_Submission
  
 5.Run the command from anaconda command promt>>``jupyter notebook Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb``
 ```  
   
 ### Known Issues :
 ```sh
 1.Set up is not done for personal Linux environment.
 
 2.Set up is not done for personal windows 10 machine.
 
 3.Some of package for python are installed manually.
 
 4. AWS setup is not working as per support project so done locally.
 ```
