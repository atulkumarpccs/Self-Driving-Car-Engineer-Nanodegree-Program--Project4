# Project 2 : Traffic Sign Classifier 
[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

The second  assignement project  in Term 1 for submission. 


[Udacity Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/self-driving-car-engineer-nanodegree--nd013)

Applying deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to classify traffic signs. Specifically to train a model to classify traffic signs.Specifically, you'll train a model to classify traffic signs from the German Traffic Sign Dataset

## Submission Requirment :
 1.The Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb notebook file with all questions answered and all code cells executed and displaying output.
 
 2.An HTML or PDF export of the project notebook with the name report.html or report.pdf.
 
 3 Any additional datasets or images used for the project that are not from the German Traffic Sign Dataset. 
 
 4.Your writeup report as a markdown or pdf file
 
 ### Acceptance Criteria :
 <https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/322/view>
 
 ### Setup Environmet :
 1.Set up `Starter Kit Installation`
 
   setup by using Anaconda
   <https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit/blob/master/README.md>
   
 2.TensorFlow
If you have access to a GPU, you should follow the TensorFlow instructions for installing TensorFlow with GPU support.

Once you've installed all of the necessary dependencies, you can install the tensorflow-gpu package:
```sh
pip install tensorflow-gpu
```

Amazon Web Services
Instead of a local GPU, you could use Amazon Web Services to launch an EC2 GPU instance. (This costs money.)

Follow the Udacity instructions to launch an EC2 GPU instance with the udacity-carnd AMI.
Complete the Setup instructions. 

 ### Build Steps :
 ```sh
 1.All steps are based on windows 10 environement.
 
 2.Acivate the environement set in first projects ``activate carnd-term1``
 
 3.Clone the project from github >>``git clone https://github.com/atulkumarpccs/Self-Driving-Car-Engineer-Nanodegree-Program--Project2 `` 
 
 4.Go to the submission folder/directory >>..Project_Submission
  
 5.Run the command from anaconda command promt>>``jupyter notebook Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb``
 ```  
   
 ### Known Issues :
 ```sh
 1.Set up is not done for personal Linux environment.
 
 2.Set up is not done for personal windows 10 machine.
 
 3.Some of package for python are installed manually.
 
 4. AWS setup is not working as per support project so done locally.
 ```
